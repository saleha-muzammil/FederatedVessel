privacy 
differential privacy , adding noise but reuqires data aggregation 
secure MPC but requires thirs party .. multi party coomunicaion
secure aggregation imppp
zero sum mask
therefore fl has been used 


cross-silo federated learning (medical, financial) 


partional -> vertical horizontal



medical image segmentation https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/7/1687
semi supervised / supervised 

CHALLENGE : SEMI SUPERVISED LEARNING , LABELLED DATA ON SERVER (UNSAFE), LABELLED UNLABELLED BOTH ON CLIENT 

CHALLENGES arising due to medical image segmentation 
statisticl heterogeneity non iid data 
limited labeling 


solution 
dynamic aggregation and knowledge distillation
